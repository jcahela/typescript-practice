/*

JavaScript was originally created to be a simple language that's flexible and easy for small applications
  - Great first language to learn, but not good for lage-scale applications with 100s or 1000s of files
  - Because JavaScript is so flexible, it DOESN'T inform you when changes in one part of the code will break other areas
  - Stricter languages that enforce types DO tell you when these app-breaking changes occur

What is TypeScript?

  Typescript is a programming language that adds TYPES to JavaScript, turning JavaScript into that stricter language

  Specifically, it allows us to write JavaScript with a set of tools called a TYPE SYSTEM, that can spot potential bugs in, clarify the structure of, and help refactor, our code

How TypeScript is used:
  1. Write in files with the extension .ts
  2. It's ran through the TypeScript TRANSPILER, which will check that the code adheres to TypeScript's standards, displaying errors if not
  3. If the TypeScript code can be converted into working JavaScript, the transpiler will output a JavaScript version of the file (.js)

Typescript is a SUPERSET of JavaScript, meaning it has all the features of JavaScript but with added features.
