/*

  - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds TYPES.
  - The TYPE SYSTEM refers to TypeScripts understanding of how your code is meant to function: data types should be stored under your variables
  - TypeScript uses TYPE INFERENCE - it expects the data type of the variable to match the type of the value initially assigned to it at declaration
  - TypeScript knows a JavaScript object's shape--or what properties and methods it contains.
  - When TypeScript is unable to infer a type, it will consider a variable to be of type 'any'
  - TYPE ANNOTATIONS are little pieces of code that indicate what type a variable is meant to be
